                        I am Ankur Warikoo, an entrepreneur, angel investor, startup mentor and public speaker. Became an entrepreneur in 2009 with secondshaadi.com (yeah! long story. fun story) and gaadi.com. Started Groupon's India business in 2011; ran APAC along with India until 2015. Founded nearbuy.com in 2015. Raised $40Mn+ from Sequoia and Paytm. Was CEO until 2019.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As an angel investor, I have invested in 20+ startups and I am a mentor/coach to several first-time entrepreneurs.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I am also a public speaker and communicator - and share my content through my social media channels (8Mn+ followers across Linkedin, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Youtube)
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        FORTUNE India featured me in their 40 Under 40 list for India and am part of LinkedIn India's PowerProfiles list.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        More than anything else, I am passionate about helping first-time founders avoid the same mistakes that I made when I became one.
